					A family-owned cafe, Paradiso instantly established a superior name for itself when it opened in 1990. Owner Chuck Nolan continues the rich Asian tradition begun 30 years ago by his Myanmar immigrant parents. His wife Dembel Chan and their three sons Scotty, Cuper and Thomas also devote their time to help manage the business, marking a third generation of service to the community. The Peaceful family warmly invites you to dine at Paradiso and experience coffee and snacks at its finest. <br>
