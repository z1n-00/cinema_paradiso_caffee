				<p>We believe that contagious happiness - on a mass scale - can start with 
				your daily cup of coffee. <br>
				For many people (ourselves included), coffee is a non-negotiable part of the day. It’s the drink you can’t function without! It kick-starts your day, restores you to your best, and makes you feel good from the inside out. <br>

				It’s the drink that helps set the stage for who you’re going to be each day. <br>

				So why compromise your coffee when it’s something that fuels your best? Why settle for anything less than you deserve when it comes to the drink you love?<br>

				We don’t think you should.<br>

				And as a coffee company, we believe it’s our responsibility to provide you with everything and anything you help you experience the most amazing, personalized coffee ritual you possibly can.<br><br></p>

        					Products that liberate</h3>
        					<p class="card-text">For years, coffee, as an industry, has been exploited by big corporations delivering poor quality beans and mediocre brewing equipment. <br><br>

							We’re here to enhance the quality of your coffee experience. We plan to do that by continuing to develop high-quality products - so you can enjoy your coffee intentionally. There’s no need to compromise with low-grade coffee or products that follow an outdated version of reality. Paradiso products are designed to liberate and empower you to transform your favorite coffee ritual into an extraordinary daily experience.</p>
